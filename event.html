                            historically constituted community. The way we understand history shapes our present and how
                            we view the world and affects how we understand reality and our own futures. A proper
                            understanding of how history shapes the present and the future is paramount to engaging and
                            understanding the world around us.</p>
                        <p>We’ve attempted to create an unbiased list that touches on the most influential and major
                            events in world history, the ones that shaped the world more than any other. Some of the
                            events cover just a few years, while others cover centuries. Some impacted only a single
                            country or continent, while others spread out and touched every continent on earth. Some are
                            violent conflicts like wars or revolutions, while others were scientific revolutions of the
                            mind that brought human beings around to whole new ways of thinking and living. But no
                            matter their differences, each of these events left behind a brave new world in their wake.
                            For the sake of historical and scientific objectivity and accuracy, this list will exclude
                            mythological events such as the Trojan War. This list will also exclude religious matters
                            such as the life of Muhammad or Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
                        <p>To that end, here is our humble attempt to list the top 5 most important historical events
                            that shaped our modern world.</p>

                        <h1>5/5</h1>
                        <h2>The Black Death (1346-53)</h2>
                        <img src="./assets/img/123rf.com-.jpg">
                        <p>The 14th century epidemic of the “Black Death,” also called the black plague or bubonic
                            plague, across Europe and Asia, has become one of the most infamous events in history. The
                            plague killed 30-60 percent of the entire population of Europe, claiming a grand total of
                            anywhere between 75 to 200 million lives. Population growth did not resume until a full
                            century later, and the world population did not recover until the 17th century. The profound
                            religious, social, and economic upheavals resulting from the Black Plague were permanent.
                        </p>
                        <p>The massive death toll caused an extreme labor shortage, which meant higher wages for the
                            peasants and a greater choice of who they wanted to work for. The land was plentiful, and
                            lords were forced to try and make conditions more attractive to the peasants. Serfdom all
                            but disappeared as a result, and this “golden age” of prosperity would not be soon
                            forgotten. Decades later, when the feudal lords tried to roll back these benefits and return
                            to the old ways, the result was widespread peasant revolts. The Black Death also helped
                            break the absolute authority of the Catholic Church.</p>

                        <h2>Fall Of Constantinople (1453)</h2>
                        <img src="./assets/img/123rf.com-.jpg">
                        <p>The fall of Constantinople came after a 53-day siege by the then 21-year-old Ottoman Sultan
                            Mehmed II, who fittingly took the title Mehmed the Conqueror. Constantinople was not just
                            any city; it was the preeminent city in the world and had been an imperial capital for
                            sixteen centuries. It had been the capital of the Roman Empire since 330 A.D.
                        </p>
                        <p>The fall of the city was considered a massive boon to Islam and a blow to Christendom.
                            Previously considered instrumental in the spread of Christianity and even named after the
                            Roman Emperor Constantine, after the Ottoman conquest the city became a stronghold for
                            Islam. The seizure of Constantinople became a precursor to further Ottoman expansion into
                            Europe. Mehmed was even able to claim the title “Caesar,” since whoever possessed the
                            imperial capital controlled the empire. The siege also marked one of the first times that
                            artillery was used in combat, and the recapture of Constantinople remained a Christian pipe
                            dream for many years after, though the Age of Crusading was at an end. The waves of
                            Byzantine scholars and refugees following the sack of Constantinople had an impact on the
                            Renaissance, bringing accumulated knowledge of the Greeks and Romans to Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>The conquest of Constantinople heralded not just the collapse of the Byzantine Empire and
                            thus the “final” end of the Roman Empire after 1,500 years, and the rise of the Ottoman
                            Empire, but also marked the end of the Middle Ages. Constantinople was renamed Istanbul and
                            became the capital of Turkey until 1923.</p>

                        <img src="./assets/img/lidenz.ru-lenin.jpg">
                        <p>The first successful socialist revolution began when the revolutionary movement in the
                            Russian Empire overthrew the autocracy under the Tsar, and then Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks
                            led a second revolution overthrowing the Provisional Government. The overthrow immediately
                            resulted in the establishment of the world’s first self-proclaimed socialist state, the
                            Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, followed by the beginning of the Russian Civil
                            War. After the socialist Red Army beat the monarchist and capitalist White Army, they
                            established the government of what would become the U.S.S.R., or Soviet Union, in 1922.
                        </p>
                        <p>The October Revolution changed the course of World War I, set the stage for World War II, the
                            rise and decline of Fascism, the spread and eventual fall of Communism, the Cold War, and
                            decolonization, and became the inspiration for many more uprisings for years to come, such
                            as the communist revolutions in Germany, Hungary, Mongolia. Cuba, Vietnam, China, and many
                            other countries.</p>

                        <h2>Assassination Of Archduke Ferdinand II (1914)</h2>
                        <img src="./assets/img/wikimedia.org_.jpg">
                        <p>Historians now say that all roads in the twentieth century lead to World War I (1914-1918),
                            which was caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian
                            throne, by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in June, 1914. By August of that year,
                            Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Germany declared war on France and Russia, and
                            Britain declared war on Germany, starting a chain reaction of events that eventually
                            involved all the great powers of the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Great War was the first time modern lethal weapons were used in conventional warfare,
                            including chemical weapons and tanks. Over 9 million people were killed and whole empires,
                            like that of Russia, Germany, the Ottomans, and Austria, were dismantled. World War II’s
                            origins can be traced back to the tenuous peace forged after WWI, known at the time as the
                            Great War. No one could imagine anything worse until the world had to face WWII a few
                            decades later.</p>

                        <h2>French Revolution (1789-94)</h2>
                        <img src="./assets/img/wikipedia.com-frenchrev.jpg">
                        <p>It is not possible to overstate the importance of the French Revolution to world history. Not
                            only did it shape the entire modern world as we know it and pave the way for capitalism to
                            conquer feudalism, it set the stage for revolutionary uprisings and changes in all parts of
                            the globe. The period of radical social and political upheaval during the French Revolution
                            and the Napoleonic Wars that followed had a lasting impact not just on France or Europe, but
                            the entire planet. It will always be remembered as the event that ended feudalism and whose
                            shockwaves led to a total transformation of social structures in every country.
                        </p>
                        <p>After the French treasury was drained (exacerbated by bankrolling and supplying the American
                            Revolution), it created much misery and hunger, which led to anger against the monarchy.
                            Images of the revolution, such as the Storming of the Bastille, the guillotine, and the
                            gigantic personality of Robespierre, are now iconic. The French Revolution introduced the
                            concept of the republic to the world, and Revolutionary France soon had to fight for its
                            life in wars against all of Europe. It laid the basis for Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup and the
                            wars that followed, which spanned every continent and introduced the modern concept of the
                            corps system for the military (replacing hired armies), and the Napoleonic Code, not to
                            mention the idea of total war.</p>
                        <p>By its mere existence and the worldwide historical and social transformations it caused, the
                            French Revolution can easily be considered the most monumental historical event of the
                            modern era, and more than any other, the defining historical event that changed the world
                            forever.</p>
